      <description>How does one possibly encompass over a decade of environmental data from numerous different satellites and multiple sensors? An averaged-out time-series is a good first step. The creation of this figure represents different variables including sea ice detections and Marine Aerosol Optical Depth (MAOD) from NASA CALIOP onboard CALIPSO, chl-a retrievals from NASA MODIS Aqua, and surface wind speed retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E).</description>
