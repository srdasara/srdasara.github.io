      <description>After qualifying for my PhD, I was understandably given advice from my committee members that ended up changing my research direction for my second chapter.
This recommendation was to backtrack and form a more thorough foundation that my earlier observations of Marine Aerosol Optical Depth (MAOD) were in fact linked to tropospheric marine aerosol. I was given a simple way of going about this study. This was to examine whether magnitudes of MAOD increase on short timescales alongside an increase in wind speed, which would indicate the likely presence of sea spray aerosol contributing to MAOD observations.</description>

      <title>Acquiring data from NASA Earth-observing satellites for Southern Ocean-scale analysis</title>

      <description>One of the most important and time-consuming steps in conducting spatiotemporal analyses, ESPECIALLY that which uses satellite data, is to get these data, convert it into readable format, and confirm that the arrays are in the correct format, layout, etc. for further imaging and statistical processing. Without a doubt, in all of the analyses I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted, this has been the steepest learning curve, and even required an internship at NASA Langley to colloborate on how best to define calculation of new variables from raw data.</description>

      <title>Southern Ocean-scale seasonal analysis</title>

      <description>Before I qualified and moved forward to PhD Candidacy, I wanted to examine what happens if I do the earlier study across the entire Southern Ocean. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled my code &amp;amp; figures for some preliminary data analysis mimicking methods from the earlier manuscript but zoomed out to the entire Southern Ocean.
Variables assessed include marine aerosol optical depth (MAOD), depolarization ratio (sea ice), chlorophyll-a concentration, and wind speed. This research is still in the works, but what is interesting is that spatial clustering of MAOD &amp;amp; sea ice, MAOD &amp;amp; wind speed, and sea ice &amp;amp; chlorophyll-a concentration is significant, also seen in and supporting the prior study!</description>
